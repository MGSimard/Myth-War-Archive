## THIS APP IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

<details>
<summary><h2>TASK LIST<h2></summary>

- [ ] Add top/left style reset on closing dialog (using dialog api instead of react render, so no useEffect unmount possible)
- [x] Add boundary constraints to prevent image from being dragged away from its constraints (snap right to right, left to left etc)
- [ ] Disable dragging in axes in which the image may be smaller than the container within that axis
- [ ] Decide on a threshold for 3rd party image hosting (100kb+?)
- [ ] For map assets, show a compressed webp of fullmap and offer a zipped download of all jpg tiles
- [ ] Decide on page subnav icons - bland svgs vs in-game UI icons
- [ ] Prettify h3 section headers
- [ ] Add class icons to races section, or full character images
- [ ] Prettify h4 section headings
- [ ] Fill out regions section
- [ ] Figure out if I want gold gradient lettering for nav icons & text (at least core ones)
- [ ] Figure out if I want header backgrounds in pages
- [ ] Nested ul submenu in nav links
- [ ] Decide if I want page footer or nav footer (icons etc)
- [ ] Think about adding a Guides page with more in-depth info for classes, guides etc rather than lore.
