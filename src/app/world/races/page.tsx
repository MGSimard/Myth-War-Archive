      <h2>Races</h2>
      <div className="heading-banner">
        <h3>Humans</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Humans are a fallen tribe and they are the weakest amongst all the races. The lives of humans are not affluent
        and stable so in order to survive, they have no choice but to do whatever they can even if it means doing
        something immoral or illegal. Smart, reckless, wicked and go-getting are the best words to describe the human
        character class in this game.
      </p>
      <h4>Paladins (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Paladins are great warriors who have a heart to save the weak.Their main purpose in life is to pursue Godliness.
        They spend their lives training themselves up in order to protect their lands and as a result, they have
        advanced combating skills and possess greater stamina and power than other classes. They are mainly noted for
        their superior crime and combat skills. Apart from the offensive side of Paladin nature, they are also good at
        defense. One can term them as moving castles during battles. However one drawback of this class is that the
        equipment they carry is relatively heavy because of all the heavy-based weapons and armor they carry and
        therefore their agility is compromised. A high level paladin is able to advance to a magic-swordsman.
      </p>
      <h4>Thieves (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Thieves are known to have a wicked and nasty nature. Their outward appearance takes on the usual shape of a slim
        body and they dress in a corset and mask mainly. Their main choice of weapons are daggers and knives. Their
        agility level is the highest amongst all classes. Obviously, they are experts in stealing money and items from
        their enemies as that is what they do. They gain fame and recognition from this activity. Their fast attacking
        speeds show no mercy to their enemies and if necessary they are able to evade attacks as well. Thieves can be
        powerful allies to team up with. A high leveled thief can be advanced to become an assassinator.
      </p>

      <div className="heading-banner">
        <h3>Centaurs</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Like humans, centaurs have a long history and civilization. In contrast with other races, centaurs have a social
        system whereby the female possesses a higher status than a male in the common population. They are prized to be
        noble and beautiful. Centaurs live at the top of the ¡°Tree of the World¡±. Since they rely on the life water
        from the ¡°Tree of the World¡±, they are able to live on over hundreds or even a thousand years. They love peace
        and like to live in a quiet environment. When Centaurs choose to apply forces, it is mainly because they are
        protecting their own land or preserving their set of rules. There is no battle in the world relevant to justice
        that Centaurs do not show up. They are born with great agility and have a higher intelligence level compared to
        humans. Greater knowledge and more magic skills make centaurs a formidable entity.
      </p>
      <h4>Archers (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Strength, agility and intelligence are never enough to archers who spend their lives to pursue peace and
        justice. They adopt range weapons, and are masters in using bows and crossbows. They are born with fantastic
        foresight that give them a great tactical advantage even before battles start. Normally, they dress lightly with
        light armors or silky clothes to make sure their agilities will not be affected; One disadvantage of this is
        that their armor shielding is low and they have low hit points as well. A high-leveled archer is up gradable to
        become a hunter.
      </p>
      <h4>Elves (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Elves have a lot of respect for nature and are often one with nature. This enables them to tune in to their
        natural healing and blessing skills. Elves are very important team platers as they move fast and attack fast as
        well as have high chances to evade attacks. Elves have great advantages when facing enemies like the undead
        because they are able to bless teammates with the force of nature. Elves however are very delicate and there is
        a strong need to protect them in battle. High leveled elves are up gradable to become Knight-elves.
      </p>

      <div className="heading-banner">
        <h3>Mages</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Mages are a combination of the human and centaur class. Their race was cursed ever since it existed and was
        cursed again after they sold their souls to the dark lord. Their skin is a weird tinge of blue due to a curse by
        the Gods. This prevents them from ever seeing or being in sunlight. The lands they inhabit are filled with
        nothing but darkness. This unfairness they felt lead to great hatred and a strong desire to take revenge.
        However they were clever to forgive to the world and progress in a more positive direction. By using their
        intelligence, they established the largest economic center in the planet and gained trust by helping strong
        races to develop and prosper.
      </p>
      <h4>Priest (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Priests are capable of casting incredibly powerful spells by utilizing the powers of wind, thunder, water and
        fire. Their brand of magic is dark in opposition to the holy one. As they are deprived of sunlight, they are
        weak at closed battle. They compensate for this weakness by having spells which can have unbelievable powers,
        having great advantages over their enemies during melee attacks. However, their weakest links are their low
        armor and low hit points. A priest is able to advance to High Priest.
      </p>
      <h4>Witches (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Witches have the power to combine ancient charms to exert influences over substances and matter. They hold the
        power to announce death and use this power in battle. They have similar attack features as priest such as low
        hit points, but they have a comparatively higher attack damage. A witch can be advanced to become a high-witch.

        <h3>Borgs</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Half human robots were developed by humans during the decades of miracles. After the ranking wars, the release
        of the power from the magical stones caused most of the infrastructure to be destroyed. Leaving the robots no
        power to maintain themselves. Most of them were shutdown having a long winter sleep under ground. Some of them
        decayed and disappeared along the way and some managed to preserve themselves. When the Myth War arrived, mages
        stumbled across them and it ignited the mages interests, since mages had been trying to develop something that
        could overcome their physical shortcomings. "Silver Driver" - an embodiment of the mages advanced intelligence
        was put in the robots body to make them move again. Parts of this robot would release rays of light as the
        Silver Driver was operating. Moreover, inspired by technology the mages invented a flight propulsion system for
        the robots which enabled them to fly without using magic.
      </p>
      <h4>Tyrants (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Tyrants emerge from the ruins so they are more adept to battle, having a super-powerful body. They are great
        experts in battle and have only one focus on their mind, to attack. Although they can only use slow and heavy
        weapons the damage inflicted is massive. They are good at absorbing hit points as well as rebounding attacks.
      </p>
      <h4>Cyborgs (subclass)</h4>
      <p>
        Cyborgs are designed to protect and prolong lives. They have resistance to all spells being machine based and
        they have a longer life span than their biological enemies. They excel in team battles due to their healing
        contribution. They are also good at solo fights. Their primary weapons are spears. As a spear is a double armed
        weapon, they cannot use shields. They have lower attacking rates, weak defense but can absorb a lot of damage.
