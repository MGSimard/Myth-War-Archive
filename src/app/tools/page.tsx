      <p>
        Links and downloads to tools and other utilities meant to aid you in dealing with they game&apos;s core files
        and assets. For the time being, most of these will be written in Python and therefore will require Python 3.6+
        to run without issues. All tools should include a README file conmtaining instructions on how to use them.
        Ideally at some point we move towards executables which don&apos;t require dependencies, building or programming
        knowledge to utilize. The goal is ease of use and accessibility for all.
